\usage{
summary_control(
  measures = NULL,
  complexity_measures = c("sparsity", "interaction_strength"),
  importance_measures = NULL,
  n_important = 15L,
  effect_measures = c("pdp", "ale"),
  fairness_measures = NULL,
  protected_attribute = NULL,
  digits = max(3L, getOption("digits") - 3L)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{measures}{(\link[mlr3:Measure]{mlr3::Measure} | list of \link[mlr3:Measure]{mlr3::Measure} | NULL)\cr
measure(s) to calculate performance on. If NULL (default), a set of
selected measures are calculated (choice depends on Learner type (classif vs. regr)).}

\item{complexity_measures}{(character)\cr
vector of complexity measures. Possible choices are "sparsity" (the number
of used features) and "interaction_strength" (see Molnar et al. (2020)).
Both are the default.}

\item{importance_measures}{(character()|NULL)\cr
vector of importance measure names. Possible choices are "pfi.\if{html}{\out{<loss>}}"
(\link[iml:FeatureImp]{iml::FeatureImp}), "pdp" (\link[iml:FeatureEffects]{iml::FeatureEffects}, see ) and
"shap" (\link[fastshap:explain]{fastshap::explain}). Default of NULL results in "pfi.\if{html}{\out{<loss>}} and
"pdp", where the \if{html}{\out{<loss>}} depends on the Learner type (classif vs. regr).}

\item{n_important}{(numeric(1))\cr
number of important variables to be displayed. Default is 15L.}

\item{effect_measures}{(character | NULL)\cr
vector of effect method names. Possible choices are "pfi" and "ale"
(see \link[iml:FeatureEffects]{iml::FeatureEffects}). Both are the default.}

\item{fairness_measures}{(\link[mlr3fairness:MeasureFairness]{mlr3fairness::MeasureFairness} |
list of \link[mlr3fairness:MeasureFairness]{mlr3fairness::MeasureFairness} | NULL)\cr
measure(s) to assess fairness. If NULL (default), a set of
selected measures are calculated (choice depends on Learner type (classif vs. regr)).}

\item{protected_attribute}{(character(1))\cr
name of the binary feature that is used as a protected attribute.
If no \code{protected_attribute} is specified (and also no \code{pta} feature is
available in the \code{mlr3::Task} for training the \code{mlr3::Learner}),
no fairness metrics are computed.}

\item{digits}{(numeric(1))\cr
the number of digits to use when printing.}
